Emotions are ever present in music. Regardless of genre, various songs of various emotions exist. The fact that it is possible to think that a song sounds happy, or angry, is evidence that music contains emotional data. However emotion of music is perhaps subjective. How sad a song sounds may perhaps differ from person to person. In this study, we present, a preliminary database to address this hypothesis. Utilizing Amazon Mechanical Turk, we collected a database of dynamic emotion ratings of selected songs, in the form of valence and arousal, along with some profile information of the participants.
